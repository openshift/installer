// This file handles correctly identifying the default release image, which is expected to be
// replaced in the binary post-compile after being extracted from a payload. The expected modification is:
//
// 1. Extract a release binary from the installer image referenced within the release image
// 2. Identify the release image pull spec, add a NUL terminator byte (0x00) to the end, calculate length
// 3. Length must be less than the marker length
// 4. Search through the installer binary looking for `\x00_RELEASE_IMAGE_LOCATION_\x00<PADDING_TO_LENGTH>`
//    where padding is the ASCII character X and length is the total length of the marker
// 5. Overwrite the beginning of the marker with the release pullspec and a NUL terminator byte (0x00)
//
// On start the installer examines the constant and if it has been modified from the default the installer
// will use that image.

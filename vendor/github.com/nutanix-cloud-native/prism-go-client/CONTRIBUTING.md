# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome. Before contributing please search the [issue tracker](../../issues). Your issue may have already been discussed or fixed in `main`. To contribute, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository, commit your changes, and [send a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

## Feature requests

Feature requests should be submitted in the [issue tracker](../../issues), with a description of the expected behavior & use case, where they'll remain closed until sufficient interest, [e.g. :+1: reactions](https://help.github.com/articles/about-discussions-in-issues-and-pull-requests/), has been [shown by the community](../../issues?q=label%3A%22votes+needed%22+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).

### Approval and release process

Pull requests approvals go through the following steps:

1. A GitHub action may be triggered to lint and test.
2. A maintainer reviews the changes. Any change requires at least one review.
3. The pull request can be merged when at least one maintainer approves it.

## Contributor License Agreement

Before you submit your pull request, you'll need to sign the [Nutanix Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.nutanix.dev/cla/). The CLA must be agreed to by all contributors who are not Nutanix Full-time Employees (FTE) or interns prior to the contribution being merged into the project codebase. The CLA is substantially similar to the Apache Contributor License Agreement, which is the industry standard CLA.

                  description: "imageTagMirrors allows images referenced by image tags in pods to be pulled from alternative mirrored repository locations. The image pull specification provided to the pod will be compared to the source locations described in imageTagMirrors and the image may be pulled down from any of the mirrors in the list instead of the specified repository allowing administrators to choose a potentially faster mirror. To use mirrors to pull images using digest specification only, users should configure a list of mirrors using \"ImageDigestMirrorSet\" CRD. \n If the image pull specification matches the repository of \"source\" in multiple imagetagmirrorset objects, only the objects which define the most specific namespace match will be used. For example, if there are objects using quay.io/libpod and quay.io/libpod/busybox as the \"source\", only the objects using quay.io/libpod/busybox are going to apply for pull specification quay.io/libpod/busybox. Each “source” repository is treated independently; configurations for different “source” repositories don’t interact. \n If the \"mirrors\" is not specified, the image will continue to be pulled from the specified repository in the pull spec. \n When multiple policies are defined for the same “source” repository, the sets of defined mirrors will be merged together, preserving the relative order of the mirrors, if possible. For example, if policy A has mirrors `a, b, c` and policy B has mirrors `c, d, e`, the mirrors will be used in the order `a, b, c, d, e`.  If the orders of mirror entries conflict (e.g. `a, b` vs. `b, a`) the configuration is not rejected but the resulting order is unspecified. Users who want to use a deterministic order of mirrors, should configure them into one list of mirrors using the expected order."

Images can be pulled from these mirrors only if they are referenced by their tags. The mirrored location is obtained by replacing the part of the input reference that matches source by the mirrors entry, e.g. for registry.redhat.io/product/repo reference, a (source, mirror) pair *.redhat.io, mirror.local/redhat causes a mirror.local/redhat/product/repo repository to be used. Pulling images by tag can potentially yield different images, depending on which endpoint we pull from. Configuring a list of mirrors using "ImageDigestMirrorSet" CRD and forcing digest-pulls for mirrors avoids that issue. The order of mirrors in this list is treated as the user''s desired priority, while source is by default considered lower priority than all mirrors. If no mirror is specified or all image pulls from the mirror list fail, the image will continue to be pulled from the repository in the pull spec unless explicitly prohibited by "mirrorSourcePolicy". Other cluster configuration, including (but not limited to) other imageTagMirrors objects, may impact the exact order mirrors are contacted in, or some mirrors may be contacted in parallel, so this should be considered a preference rather than a guarantee of ordering. "mirrors" uses one of the following formats: host[:port] host[:port]/namespace[/namespace…] host[:port]/namespace[/namespace…]/repo for more information about the format, see the document about the location field: https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-registries.conf.5.md#choosing-a-registry-toml-table'

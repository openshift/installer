Async I/O and timers.

This crate provides two tools:

* `Async`, an adapter for standard networking types (and [many other] types) to use in
  async programs.
* `Timer`, a future that expires at a point in time.

For concrete async networking types built on top of this crate, see [`async-net`].

[`async-net`]: https://docs.rs/async-net

## Implementation

The first time `Async` or `Timer` is used, a thread named "async-io" will be spawned.
The purpose of this thread is to wait for I/O events reported by the operating system, and then
wake appropriate futures blocked on I/O or timers when they can be resumed.

To wait for the next I/O event, the "async-io" thread uses [epoll] on Linux/Android/illumos,
[kqueue] on macOS/iOS/BSD, [event ports] on illumos/Solaris, and [wepoll] on Windows. That
functionality is provided by the [`polling`] crate.

However, note that you can also process I/O events and wake futures on any thread using the
`block_on()` function. The "async-io" thread is therefore just a fallback mechanism
processing I/O events in case no other threads are.

## Examples

Connect to `example.com:80`, or time out after 10 seconds.

```rust
use async_io::{Async, Timer};
use futures_lite::{future::FutureExt, io};

use std::net::{TcpStream, ToSocketAddrs};
use std::time::Duration;

let addr = "example.com:80".to_socket_addrs()?.next().unwrap();

let stream = Async::<TcpStream>::connect(addr).or(async {
    Timer::after(Duration::from_secs(10)).await;
    Err(io::ErrorKind::TimedOut.into())
})
.await?;
```

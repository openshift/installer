# Netlink

This project aims at providing building blocks for [netlink][man-netlink] (see `man 7 netlink`).

## Organization

- the [`netlink_sys`](./netlink-sys) crate provides netlink sockets. Integration with [`mio`][mio] and [`tokio`][tokio]
  is optional.
- Each netlink protocol has a `netlink-packet-<protocol_name>` crate that provides the packets for this protocol:
    - [`netlink-packet-route`](./netlink-packet-route) provides messages for the [route protocol][man-rtnetlink]
    - [`netlink-packet-audit`](./netlink-packet-audit) provides messages for the [audit][man-audit] protocol
    - [`netlink-packet-sock-diag`](./netlink-packet-sock-diag) provides messages for the [sock-diag][man-sock-diag]
      protocol
- the [`netlink-packet-core`](./netlink-packet-core) is the glue for all the other `netlink-packet-*` crates. It
  provides a `NetlinkMessage<T>` type that represent any netlink message for any sub-protocol.
- the [`netlink_proto`](./netlink-proto) crate is an asynchronous implementation of the netlink protocol. It only
  depends on `netlink-packet-core` for the `NetlinkMessage` type and `netlink-sys` for the socket.
- the [`rtnetlink`](./rtnetlink) crate provides higher level abstraction for the [route protocol][man-rtnetlink]
- the [`audit`](./audit) crate provides higher level abstractions for the audit protocol.
- the [`netlink-packet-generic`](./netlink-packet-generic) crate provide
  message for the [generic netlink][man-genl]
- the [`genetlink`](./genetlink) crate provide higher level abstraction for the
  [generic netlink protocol][man-genl]
- the [`ethtool`](./ethtool) crate provide higher level abstraction for
  [ethtool netlink protocol][ethtool-kernel-doc]


## Altnernatives

## Credits

My main resource so far has been the source code of [`pyroute2`][pyroute2] (python) and [`netlink`][netlink-go] (golang)
a lot. These two projects are great, and very nicely written. As someone who does not read C fluently, and that does not
know much about netlink, they have been invaluable.

I'd also like to praise [`libnl`][libnl] for its documentation. It helped me a lot in understanding the protocol basics.

The whole packet parsing logic is inspired by @whitequark excellent blog posts ([part 1][whitequark-1], [part
2][whitequark-2] and [part 3][whitequark-3], although I've only really used the concepts described in the first blog
post).

Thanks also to the people behind [tokio](tokio.rs) for the amazing
tool they are building, and the support they provide.

| tectonic_etcd_ca_cert_path | (optional) The path of the file containing the CA certificate for TLS communication with etcd.<br><br>Note: This works only when used in conjunction with an external etcd cluster. If set, the variable `tectonic_etcd_servers` must also be set. | string | `/dev/null` |
| tectonic_etcd_client_cert_path | (optional) The path of the file containing the client certificate for TLS communication with etcd.<br><br>Note: This works only when used in conjunction with an external etcd cluster.

| tectonic_etcd_client_key_path | (optional) The path of the file containing the client key for TLS communication with etcd.<br><br>Note: This works only when used in conjunction with an external etcd cluster.

| tectonic_etcd_tls_enabled | (optional) If set to `true`, all etcd endpoints will be configured to use the "https" scheme.<br><br>Note: If `tectonic_experimental` is set to `true` this variable has no effect, because the experimental self-hosted etcd always uses TLS. | string | `true` |

Network policy is implemented by Calico.<br><br>- "calico": [ALPHA] enables BGP based networking. Routing and network policy is implemented by Calico. Note this has been tested on baremetal installations only.<br><br>- "none": disables the installation of any Pod level networking layer provided by Tectonic. By setting this value, users are expected to deploy their own solution to enable network connectivity for Pods and Services. | string | `flannel` |
| tectonic_pull_secret_path | The path the pull secret file in JSON format. This is known to be a "Docker pull secret" as produced by the docker login [1] command. A sample JSON content is shown in [2].

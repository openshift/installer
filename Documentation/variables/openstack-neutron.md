# Terraform variables
This document gives an overview of variables used in the Openstack/Neutron platform of the Tectonic SDK.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|
| tectonic_openstack_dns_nameservers | The nameservers used by the nodes and the generated OpenStack subnet resource.<br><br>Example: `["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]` | list | `<list>` |
| tectonic_openstack_etcd_flavor_id | (optional) The flavor id for etcd instances as given in `openstack flavor list`. Specifies the size (CPU/Memory/Drive) of the VM.<br><br>Note: Set either tectonic_openstack_etcd_flavor_name or tectonic_openstack_etcd_flavor_id. Note: This value is ignored for self-hosted etcd. | string | `` |
| tectonic_openstack_etcd_flavor_name | (optional) The flavor name for etcd instances as given in `openstack flavor list`. Specifies the size (CPU/Memory/Drive) of the VM.<br><br>Note: Set either tectonic_openstack_etcd_flavor_name or tectonic_openstack_etcd_flavor_id. Note: This value is ignored for self-hosted etcd. | string | `` |
| tectonic_openstack_external_gateway_id | The ID of the network to be used as the external internet gateway as given in `openstack network list`. | string | - |
| tectonic_openstack_floatingip_pool | The name name of the floating IP pool as given in `openstack floating ip list`. This pool will be used to assign floating IPs to worker and master nodes. | string | `public` |
| tectonic_openstack_image_id | The image ID as given in `openstack image list`. Specifies the OS image of the VM.<br><br>Note: Set either tectonic_openstack_image_name or tectonic_openstack_image_id. | string | `` |
| tectonic_openstack_image_name | The image ID as given in `openstack image list`. Specifies the OS image of the VM.<br><br>Note: Set either tectonic_openstack_image_name or tectonic_openstack_image_id. | string | `` |
| tectonic_openstack_master_flavor_id | The flavor id for master instances as given in `openstack flavor list`. Specifies the size (CPU/Memory/Drive) of the VM.<br><br>Note: Set either tectonic_openstack_master_flavor_name or tectonic_openstack_master_flavor_id. | string | `` |
| tectonic_openstack_master_flavor_name | The flavor name for master instances as given in `openstack flavor list`. Specifies the size (CPU/Memory/Drive) of the VM.<br><br>Note: Set either tectonic_openstack_master_flavor_name or tectonic_openstack_master_flavor_id. | string | `` |
| tectonic_openstack_neutron_config_version | (internal) This declares the version of the OpenStack Neutron configuration variables. It has no impact on generated assets but declares the version contract of the configuration. | string | `1.0` |
| tectonic_openstack_subnet_cidr | The subnet CIDR for the master/worker/etcd compute nodes. This CIDR will also be assigned to the created the OpenStack subnet resource. | string | `192.168.1.0/24` |
| tectonic_openstack_worker_flavor_id | The flavor id for worker instances as given in `openstack flavor list`. Specifies the size (CPU/Memory/Drive) of the VM.<br><br>Note: Set either tectonic_openstack_worker_flavor_name or tectonic_openstack_worker_flavor_id. | string | `` |
| tectonic_openstack_worker_flavor_name | The flavor name for worker instances as given in `openstack flavor list`. Specifies the size (CPU/Memory/Drive) of the VM.<br><br>Note: Set either tectonic_openstack_worker_flavor_name or tectonic_openstack_worker_flavor_id. | string | `` |

# The name of the cluster.
# If used in a cloud-environment, this will be prepended to `baseDomain` resulting in the URL to the Tectonic console.

# Warning: Special characters in the name like '.' may cause errors on OpenStack platforms due to resource name constraints.

  # (optional) This declares the MTU used by Calico.
  # mtu:

  # (optional) This declares the IP range to assign Kubernetes pod IPs in CIDR notation.

  # (optional) This declares the IP range to assign Kubernetes service cluster IPs in CIDR notation.
  # The maximum size of this IP range is /12
  serviceCIDR: 10.3.0.0/16

  # (optional) Configures the network to be used in Tectonic. One of the following values can be used:
  #
  # - "flannel": enables overlay networking only. This is implemented by flannel using VXLAN.
  #
  # - "canal": enables overlay networking including network policy. Overlay is implemented by flannel using VXLAN. Network policy is implemented by Calico.
  #
  # - "calico-ipip": [ALPHA] enables BGP based networking. Routing and network policy is implemented by Calico. Note this has been tested on baremetal installations only.
  #
  # - "none": disables the installation of any Pod level networking layer provided by Tectonic. By setting this value, users are expected to deploy their own solution to enable network connectivity for Pods and Services.

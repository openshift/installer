metadata:

  # The name of the cluster.
  # If used in a cloud-environment, this will be prepended to `baseDomain` to construct a domain for the OpenShift console.
  #
  # Note: This field MUST be set manually prior to creating the cluster.
  # Warning: Special characters in the name like '.' may cause errors on OpenStack platforms due to resource name constraints.
  name:

# (optional) A cluster ID for this cluster.
# This defaults to a random ID.
clusterID:

admin:
  email: a@b.c
  password: verysecure
  sshKey: "ssh-ed25519 AAAA..."

# The base DNS domain of the cluster. It must NOT contain a trailing period. Some
# DNS providers will automatically add this if necessary.
#
# Example: `openshift.example.com`.
#
# Note: This field MUST be set manually prior to creating the cluster.
baseDomain:

networking:
  # This declares the IP range to assign Kubernetes pod IPs in CIDR notation.
  podCIDR: 10.2.0.0/16

  # This declares the IP range to assign Kubernetes service cluster IPs in CIDR notation.
  # The maximum size of this IP range is /12
  serviceCIDR: 10.3.0.0/16

  # (optional) Configures the network to be used in the cluster. One of the following values can be used:
  #
  # - "flannel": enables overlay networking only. This is implemented by flannel using VXLAN.
  #
  # - "canal": enables overlay networking including network policy. Overlay is implemented by flannel using VXLAN. Network policy is implemented by Calico.
  #
  # - "calico-ipip": [ALPHA] enables BGP based networking. Routing and network policy is implemented by Calico. Note this has been tested on baremetal installations only.
  #
  # - "none": disables the installation of any Pod level networking layer. By setting this value, users are expected to deploy their own solution to enable network connectivity for Pods and Services.
  # type: flannel

machines:
  - name: master
    replicas: 1

  - name: worker
    replicas: 3

platform:
  aws:
    # The target AWS region for the cluster.
    region: us-east-1

    # (optional) Additional tags for AWS resources created for the cluster.
    #
    # Example: {"key": "value", "foo": "bar"}
    # userTags:

    # (optional) ID of an existing VPC to launch nodes into.
    # If unset a new VPC is created.
    #
    # Example: `vpc-123456`
    # vpcID:

    # Block of IP addresses used by the VPC.
    # This should not overlap with any other networks, such as a private datacenter connected via Direct Connect.
    vpcCIDRBlock: 10.0.0.0/16

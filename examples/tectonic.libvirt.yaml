# The base DNS domain of the cluster. It must NOT contain a trailing period. Some
# DNS providers will automatically add this if necessary.

# Note: This field MUST be set manually prior to creating the cluster.

# [Azure-specific NOTE]
# To use Azure-provided DNS, `BaseDomain` should be set to `""`
# If using DNS records, ensure that `BaseDomain` is set to a properly configured external DNS zone.

  # (optional) Configures the network to be used in Tectonic. One of the following values can be used:
  #
  # - "flannel": enables overlay networking only. This is implemented by flannel using VXLAN.
  #
  # - "canal": enables overlay networking including network policy. Overlay is implemented by flannel using VXLAN. Network policy is implemented by Calico.
  #
  # - "calico-ipip": [ALPHA] enables BGP based networking. Routing and network policy is implemented by Calico. Note this has been tested on baremetal installations only.
  #
  # - "none": disables the installation of any Pod level networking layer provided by Tectonic. By setting this value, users are expected to deploy their own solution to enable network connectivity for Pods and Services.

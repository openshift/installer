// We generate the UUID using UUIDv5 with a seed string based on the group, kind, namespace and name.
// We include the namespace and name to ensure no two RoleAssignments in the same cluster can end up
// with the same UUID.
// We include the group and kind to ensure that different kinds of resources get different UUIDs. This isn't
// entirely required by Azure, but it makes sense to avoid collisions between two resources of different types
// even if they have the same namespace and name.
// We include the owner group, kind, and name to avoid collisions between resources with the same name in different
// clusters that actually point to different Azure resources.
// In the rare case users have multiple ASO instances with resources in the same namespace in each cluster
// having the same name but not actually pointing to the same Azure resource (maybe in a different subscription?)
// they can avoid name conflicts by explicitly specifying AzureName for their RoleAssignment.

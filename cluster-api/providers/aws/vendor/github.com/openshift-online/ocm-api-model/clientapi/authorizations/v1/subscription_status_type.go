	// whose resources do not yet exist, but are expected to exist soon. Creating a reserved subscription allows services to reserve quota

	// is moved to stale to indicate to users that OCM can no longer see the Active resources. Subscriptions in stale state will automatically
	// transition back to active if the resources stat reporting again. They will also transition to Disconnected or Archived if the
	// resources never resume reporting.

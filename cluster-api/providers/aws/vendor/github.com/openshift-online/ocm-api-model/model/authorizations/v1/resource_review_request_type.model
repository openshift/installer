enum SubscriptionStatus {
	// Active state subscriptions have their related resources currently running and reporting an active state
	// Whether a subscription is active is determined depending on the plan of the subscription
	// For example, OCP subscriptions are active if the OCP cluster is successfully reporting metrics
	//              RHOSR subscriptions are active if the service-registry service determines they are, the service updates the subscription as necessary
	Active

	// Subscriptions move to Archived when the resources are no longer visibile to OCM and suspected removed
	// Users can also move some disconnected subscriptions to archived state
	// If a subscription in Archived state's resources start reporting again, the subscription may move back to Active
	Archived

	// Deprovisioned subscriptions can be considered completely deleted. As of this writing, only managed plan subscriptions are completely
	// deleted. Instead of actual DB row deletion, subscriptions are moved to Deprovisioned status and all associated resources (quota,
	// roles, etc) are _actually_ deleted. This allows us to keep track of what subscriptions existed and when.
	Deprovisioned

	// Disconnected subscriptions are Active subscriptions that are intentionally not reporting an active state. There may be some
	// desire by the subscription owner not to connect the resources to OCM. This status allows the subscription to stay in OCM without
	// automatically moving to Stale or Archived.
	Disconnected

	// Reserved subscriptions are created during the resource installation process. A reserved subscription represents a subscription
	// whose resources do not yet exist, but are expected to exist soon. Creating a reserved subscription allows services to reserve quota
	// for resources that are in the process of creation. Services are expected to update the status to Active or Deprovisioned once
	// the creation process completes, or fails.
	Reserved

	// Stale subscriptions are active subscriptions who have stopped reporting an active state. Once reports cease, the subscription
	// is moved to stale to indicate to users that OCM can no longer see the Active resources. Subscriptions in stale state will automatically
	// transition back to active if the resources stat reporting again. They will also transition to Disconnected or Archived if the
	// resources never resume reporting.
	Stale

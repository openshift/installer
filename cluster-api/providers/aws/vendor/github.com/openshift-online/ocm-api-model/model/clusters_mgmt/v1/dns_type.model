// DNS settings of the cluster.
struct DNS {
	// Base DNS domain of the cluster.
	//
	// During the installation of the cluster it is necessary to create multiple DNS records.
	// They will be created as sub-domains of this domain. For example, if the domain_prefix of the
	// cluster is `mycluster` and the base domain is `example.com` then the following DNS
	// records will be created:
	//
	// ```
	// mycluster-api.example.com
	// mycluster-etcd-0.example.com
	// mycluster-etcd-1.example.com
	// mycluster-etcd-3.example.com
	// ```
	//
	// The exact number, type and names of the created DNS record depends on the characteristics
	// of the cluster, and may be different for different versions of _OpenShift_. Please don't
	// rely on them. For example, to find what is the URL of the Kubernetes API server of the
	// cluster don't assume that it will be `mycluster-api.example.com`. Instead of that use
	// this API to retrieve the description of the cluster, and get it from the `api.url`
	// attribute. For example, if the identifier of the cluster is `123` send a request like
	// this:
	//
	// ```http
	// GET /api/clusters_mgmt/v1/clusters/123 HTTP/1.1
	// ```
	//
	// That will return a response like this, including the `api.url` attribute:
	//
	// ```json
	// {
	//     "kind": "Cluster",
	//     "id": "123",
	//     "href": "/api/clusters_mgmt/v1/clusters/123",
	//         "api": {
	//         "url": "https://mycluster-api.example.com:6443"
	//     },
	//     ...
	// }
	// ```
	//
	// When the cluster is created in Amazon Web Services it is necessary to create this base
	// DNS domain in advance, using AWS Route53 (https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53).

# Experimental ProviderData And ServiceData Interfaces

This package contains experimental `ProviderData` and `ServiceData` interfaces:

* `ProviderData` is the interface implemented by the (primary) provider's `Meta` value (currently [`conns.AWSClient`](../../conns/awsclient.go))
* `ServiceData` is implemented by a structure defined in each service package

# Terraform AWS Provider EventBridge Package

This area is primarily for AWS provider contributors and maintainers. For information on _using_ Terraform and the AWS provider, see the links below.

_EventBridge_ was formerly called _CloudWatch Events_. In the AWS CLI, you use `events` to identify EventBridge commands. The functionality is identical.

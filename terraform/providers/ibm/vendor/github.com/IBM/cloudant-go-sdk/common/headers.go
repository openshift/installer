// GetSdkHeaders - returns the set of SDK-specific headers to be included in an outgoing request.
//
// This function is invoked by generated service methods (i.e. methods which implement the REST API operations
// defined within the API definition). The purpose of this function is to give the SDK implementor the opportunity
// to provide SDK-specific HTTP headers that will be sent with an outgoing REST API request.
// This function is invoked for each invocation of a generated service method,
// so the set of HTTP headers could be request-specific.
//
// Parameters:
//
//	serviceName - the name of the service as defined in the API definition (e.g. "MyService1")
//	serviceVersion - the version of the service as defined in the API definition (e.g. "V1")
//	operationId - the operationId as defined in the API definition (e.g. getContext)
//
// Returns:
//
//	a Map which contains the set of headers to be included in the REST API request

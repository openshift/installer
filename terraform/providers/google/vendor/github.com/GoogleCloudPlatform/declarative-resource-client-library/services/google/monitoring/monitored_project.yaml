  title: Monitoring/MonitoredProject
  description: Monitored Project allows you to set a project as monitored by a _metrics
    scope_, which is a term for a project used to group the metrics of multiple projects,
    potentially across multiple organizations.  This enables you to view these groups
    in the Monitoring page of the cloud console.

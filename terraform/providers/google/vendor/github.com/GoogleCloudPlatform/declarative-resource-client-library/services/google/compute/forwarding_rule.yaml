If a match takes place, the relevant configuration is made available to those proxies. Otherwise, all the resources (e.g. `TargetHttpProxy`, `UrlMap`) referenced by the `ForwardingRule` will not be visible to those proxies.

If its `filterMatchCriteria` is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its `filterLabel`s must match with corresponding labels provided in the metadata.

            `metadataFilters` specified here will be applifed before those specified in the `UrlMap` that this `ForwardingRule` references.

            [RFC1035](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt). Specifically, the label
            must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`
            which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
            characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
            character, which cannot be a dash. This field is only used for internal

            For regional forwarding rules, this target must live in the same region
            as the forwarding rule. For global forwarding rules, this target must
            be a global load balancing resource. The forwarded traffic must be of
            a type appropriate to the target object. For `INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED` load
            balancing, only `targetHttpProxy` is valid, not `targetHttpsProxy`.

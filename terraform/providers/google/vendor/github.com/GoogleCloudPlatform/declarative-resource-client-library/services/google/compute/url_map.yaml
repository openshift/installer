            `defaultRouteAction` takes effect when none of the `hostRule`s match. The load balancer performs advanced routing actions like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the request to the selected backend. If `defaultRouteAction` specifies any `weightedBackendService`s, `defaultService` must not be set. Conversely if `defaultService` is set, `defaultRouteAction` cannot contain any weightedBackendServices.

            Only one of `defaultRouteAction` or `defaultUrlRedirect` must be set.

                          *   `5xx`: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all, example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused streams.
                          *   `gateway-error`: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes 502, 503 or 504.

                          *   `connect-failure`: Loadbalancer will retry on failures connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
                          *   `retriable-4xx`: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes. Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                          *   `refused-stream`:Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
                          *   `cancelled`Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to `cancelled`
                          *   `deadline-exceeded`: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to `deadline-exceeded`
                          *   `resource-exhausted`: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to `resource-exhausted`
                          *   `unavailable`: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to `unavailable`

                        For `routeRules` within a given `pathMatcher`, priority determines the order in which load balancer will interpret `routeRules`. `RouteRules` are evaluated in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule that matches the request is applied.

                        You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority. Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and 2147483647 inclusive.

                        Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the future without any impact on existing rules.

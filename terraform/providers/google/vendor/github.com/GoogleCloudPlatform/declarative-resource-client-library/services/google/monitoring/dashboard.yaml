                                            Each subset contains time series that
                                            have the same value for each of the grouping
                                            fields. Each individual time series is
                                            a member of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`

                                            and all the time series have the same

                                            fields. Each individual time series is

                                            to be mathematically grouped together,
                                            resulting in a single data point for each

                                                The `group_by_fields` determine how
                                                the time series are partitioned into
                                                subsets prior to applying the aggregation
                                                operation. Each subset contains time
                                                series that have the same value for
                                                each of the grouping fields. Each
                                                individual time series is a member
                                                of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`
                                                is applied to each subset of time
                                                series. It is not possible to reduce
                                                across different resource types, so
                                                this field implicitly contains `resource.type`.  Fields

                                                then the time series are aggregated
                                                into a single output time series.

                                                Except for `ALIGN_NONE`, all alignments
                                                cause all the data points in an `alignment_period`
                                                to be mathematically grouped together,
                                                resulting in a single data point for

                                                alignment operations may be applied
                                                to all time series. The valid choices
                                                depend on the `metric_kind` and `value_type`

                                                series data must be aligned in order

                                            The `group_by_fields` determine how the
                                            time series are partitioned into subsets
                                            prior to applying the aggregation operation.
                                            Each subset contains time series that
                                            have the same value for each of the grouping
                                            fields. Each individual time series is
                                            a member of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`
                                            is applied to each subset of time series.

                                            contains `resource.type`.  Fields not
                                            specified in `group_by_fields` are aggregated
                                            away.  If `group_by_fields` is not specified
                                            and all the time series have the same
                                            resource type, then the time series are
                                            aggregated into a single output time series.

                                          prior to applying the aggregation operation.
                                          Each subset contains time series that have
                                          the same value for each of the grouping
                                          fields. Each individual time series is a
                                          member of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`

                                          The `group_by_fields` determine how the
                                          time series are partitioned into subsets
                                          prior to applying the aggregation operation.
                                          Each subset contains time series that have
                                          the same value for each of the grouping
                                          fields. Each individual time series is a
                                          member of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`
                                          is applied to each subset of time series.
                                          It is not possible to reduce across different

                                          the time series have the same resource type,

                                          to all time series. The valid choices depend
                                          on the `metric_kind` and `value_type` of
                                          the original time series. Alignment can

                                          of the time series.  Time series data must

                                                when `cross_series_reducer` is specified.
                                                The `group_by_fields` determine how
                                                the time series are partitioned into
                                                subsets prior to applying the aggregation
                                                operation. Each subset contains time
                                                series that have the same value for
                                                each of the grouping fields. Each
                                                individual time series is a member
                                                of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`
                                                is applied to each subset of time
                                                series. It is not possible to reduce
                                                across different resource types, so
                                                this field implicitly contains `resource.type`.  Fields
                                                not specified in `group_by_fields`
                                                are aggregated away.  If `group_by_fields`
                                                is not specified and all the time
                                                series have the same resource type,
                                                then the time series are aggregated
                                                into a single output time series.
                                                If `cross_series_reducer` is not defined,
                                                this field is ignored.

                                                The `group_by_fields` determine how
                                                the time series are partitioned into
                                                subsets prior to applying the aggregation
                                                operation. Each subset contains time
                                                series that have the same value for
                                                each of the grouping fields. Each
                                                individual time series is a member
                                                of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`
                                                is applied to each subset of time

                                                into a single output time series.

                                                cause all the data points in an `alignment_period`
                                                to be mathematically grouped together,
                                                resulting in a single data point for

                                                to all time series. The valid choices
                                                depend on the `metric_kind` and `value_type`

                                                series data must be aligned in order

                                            The `group_by_fields` determine how the

                                            Each subset contains time series that
                                            have the same value for each of the grouping
                                            fields. Each individual time series is
                                            a member of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`

                                            away.  If `group_by_fields` is not specified
                                            and all the time series have the same

                                            aggregated into a single output time series.

                              the scorecard is in a warning state - unless x also
                              puts it in a danger state. (Danger trumps warning.)  As
                              an example, consider a scorecard with the following
                              four thresholds: {   value: 90,   category: ''DANGER'',   trigger:
                              ''ABOVE'', },: {   value: 70,   category: ''WARNING'',   trigger:
                              ''ABOVE'', }, {   value: 10,   category: ''DANGER'',   trigger:
                              ''BELOW'', }, {   value: 20,   category: ''WARNING'',   trigger:
                              ''BELOW'', }  Then: values less than or equal to 10
                              would put the scorecard in a DANGER state, values greater
                              than 10 but less than or equal to 20 a WARNING state,
                              values strictly between 20 and 70 an OK state, values
                              greater than or equal to 70 but less than 90 a WARNING
                              state, and values greater than or equal to 90 a DANGER
                              state.'

                                        description: An `Aligner` describes how to
                                          bring the data points in a single time series
                                          into temporal alignment. Except for `ALIGN_NONE`,
                                          all alignments cause all the data points
                                          in an `alignment_period` to be mathematically
                                          grouped together, resulting in a single
                                          data point for each `alignment_period` with
                                          end timestamp at the end of the period.  Not
                                          all alignment operations may be applied
                                          to all time series. The valid choices depend
                                          on the `metric_kind` and `value_type` of
                                          the original time series. Alignment can
                                          change the `metric_kind` or the `value_type`
                                          of the time series.  Time series data must
                                          be aligned in order to perform cross-time
                                          series reduction. If `cross_series_reducer`

                                          The `group_by_fields` determine how the
                                          time series are partitioned into subsets
                                          prior to applying the aggregation operation.
                                          Each subset contains time series that have
                                          the same value for each of the grouping
                                          fields. Each individual time series is a
                                          member of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`
                                          is applied to each subset of time series.
                                          It is not possible to reduce across different
                                          resource types, so this field implicitly
                                          contains `resource.type`.  Fields not specified
                                          in `group_by_fields` are aggregated away.  If
                                          `group_by_fields` is not specified and all
                                          the time series have the same resource type,
                                          then the time series are aggregated into
                                          a single output time series. If `cross_series_reducer`
                                          is not defined, this field is ignored.

                                          bring the data points in a single time series
                                          into temporal alignment. Except for `ALIGN_NONE`,
                                          all alignments cause all the data points
                                          in an `alignment_period` to be mathematically
                                          grouped together, resulting in a single
                                          data point for each `alignment_period` with
                                          end timestamp at the end of the period.  Not
                                          all alignment operations may be applied
                                          to all time series. The valid choices depend
                                          on the `metric_kind` and `value_type` of
                                          the original time series. Alignment can
                                          change the `metric_kind` or the `value_type`
                                          of the time series.  Time series data must
                                          be aligned in order to perform cross-time
                                          series reduction. If `cross_series_reducer`
                                          is specified, then `per_series_aligner`

                                              The `group_by_fields` determine how
                                              the time series are partitioned into
                                              subsets prior to applying the aggregation
                                              operation. Each subset contains time
                                              series that have the same value for
                                              each of the grouping fields. Each individual
                                              time series is a member of exactly one
                                              subset. The `cross_series_reducer` is
                                              applied to each subset of time series.
                                              It is not possible to reduce across

                                              implicitly contains `resource.type`.  Fields

                                              output time series. If `cross_series_reducer`
                                              is not defined, this field is ignored.

                                              the original time series. Alignment
                                              can change the `metric_kind` or the

                                              when `cross_series_reducer` is specified.
                                              The `group_by_fields` determine how
                                              the time series are partitioned into
                                              subsets prior to applying the aggregation
                                              operation. Each subset contains time
                                              series that have the same value for
                                              each of the grouping fields. Each individual
                                              time series is a member of exactly one
                                              subset. The `cross_series_reducer` is
                                              applied to each subset of time series.
                                              It is not possible to reduce across
                                              different resource types, so this field
                                              implicitly contains `resource.type`.  Fields
                                              not specified in `group_by_fields` are
                                              aggregated away.  If `group_by_fields`
                                              is not specified and all the time series
                                              have the same resource type, then the
                                              time series are aggregated into a single
                                              output time series. If `cross_series_reducer`
                                              is not defined, this field is ignored.

                                              Except for `ALIGN_NONE`, all alignments
                                              cause all the data points in an `alignment_period`
                                              to be mathematically grouped together,
                                              resulting in a single data point for
                                              each `alignment_period` with end timestamp

                                              operations may be applied to all time
                                              series. The valid choices depend on
                                              the `metric_kind` and `value_type` of
                                              the original time series. Alignment
                                              can change the `metric_kind` or the
                                              `value_type` of the time series.  Time
                                              series data must be aligned in order

                                          The `group_by_fields` determine how the

                                          prior to applying the aggregation operation.
                                          Each subset contains time series that have
                                          the same value for each of the grouping
                                          fields. Each individual time series is a
                                          member of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`
                                          is applied to each subset of time series.

                                                to all time series. The valid choices
                                                depend on the `metric_kind` and the

                                                series. Reduction can yield a time
                                                series with a different `metric_kind`
                                                or `value_type` than the input time
                                                series.  Time series data must first

                                                in order to perform cross-time series

                                                the time series are partitioned into

                                                operation. Each subset contains time
                                                series that have the same value for

                                                series. Reduction can yield a time

                                                The `group_by_fields` determine how
                                                the time series are partitioned into
                                                subsets prior to applying the aggregation
                                                operation. Each subset contains time
                                                series that have the same value for
                                                each of the grouping fields. Each

                                                of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`
                                                is applied to each subset of time

                                                this field implicitly contains `resource.type`.  Fields

                                                into a single output time series.

                                less than or equal to 10 would put the scorecard in
                                a DANGER state, values greater than 10 but less than

                                            The `group_by_fields` determine how the
                                            time series are partitioned into subsets
                                            prior to applying the aggregation operation.
                                            Each subset contains time series that
                                            have the same value for each of the grouping
                                            fields. Each individual time series is
                                            a member of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`
                                            is applied to each subset of time series.
                                            It is not possible to reduce across different
                                            resource types, so this field implicitly
                                            contains `resource.type`.  Fields not
                                            specified in `group_by_fields` are aggregated
                                            away.  If `group_by_fields` is not specified
                                            and all the time series have the same
                                            resource type, then the time series are
                                            aggregated into a single output time series.
                                            If `cross_series_reducer` is not defined,
                                            this field is ignored.

                                          description: An `Aligner` describes how
                                            to bring the data points in a single time

                                            for `ALIGN_NONE`, all alignments cause
                                            all the data points in an `alignment_period`
                                            to be mathematically grouped together,
                                            resulting in a single data point for each
                                            `alignment_period` with end timestamp
                                            at the end of the period.  Not all alignment
                                            operations may be applied to all time
                                            series. The valid choices depend on the
                                            `metric_kind` and `value_type` of the
                                            original time series. Alignment can change
                                            the `metric_kind` or the `value_type`
                                            of the time series.  Time series data
                                            must be aligned in order to perform cross-time

                                            when `cross_series_reducer` is specified.
                                            The `group_by_fields` determine how the
                                            time series are partitioned into subsets
                                            prior to applying the aggregation operation.
                                            Each subset contains time series that
                                            have the same value for each of the grouping
                                            fields. Each individual time series is
                                            a member of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`
                                            is applied to each subset of time series.
                                            It is not possible to reduce across different
                                            resource types, so this field implicitly
                                            contains `resource.type`.  Fields not
                                            specified in `group_by_fields` are aggregated
                                            away.  If `group_by_fields` is not specified
                                            and all the time series have the same
                                            resource type, then the time series are
                                            aggregated into a single output time series.
                                            If `cross_series_reducer` is not defined,
                                            this field is ignored.

                                            resulting in a single data point for each

                                                aligned values in the input time series.  Not
                                                all reducer operations can be applied
                                                to all time series. The valid choices
                                                depend on the `metric_kind` and the
                                                `value_type` of the original time
                                                series. Reduction can yield a time
                                                series with a different `metric_kind`
                                                or `value_type` than the input time
                                                series.  Time series data must first
                                                be aligned (see `per_series_aligner`)
                                                in order to perform cross-time series

                                                the time series are partitioned into

                                                operation. Each subset contains time
                                                series that have the same value for
                                                each of the grouping fields. Each

                                                of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`

                                            operations may be applied to all time
                                            series. The valid choices depend on the

                                            original time series. Alignment can change
                                            the `metric_kind` or the `value_type`
                                            of the time series.  Time series data
                                            must be aligned in order to perform cross-time
                                            series reduction. If `cross_series_reducer`

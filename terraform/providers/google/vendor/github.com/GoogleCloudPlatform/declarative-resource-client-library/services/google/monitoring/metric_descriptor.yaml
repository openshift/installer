          description: 'The units in which the metric value is reported. It is only
            applicable if the `value_type` is `INT64`, `DOUBLE`, or `DISTRIBUTION`.
            The `unit` defines the representation of the stored metric values. Different
            systems might scale the values to be more easily displayed (so a value
            of `0.02kBy` _might_ be displayed as `20By`, and a value of `3523kBy`
            _might_ be displayed as `3.5MBy`). However, if the `unit` is `kBy`, then
            the value of the metric is always in thousands of bytes, no matter how
            it might be displayed. If you want a custom metric to record the exact
            number of CPU-seconds used by a job, you can create an `INT64 CUMULATIVE`
            metric whose `unit` is `s{CPU}` (or equivalently `1s{CPU}` or just `s`).
            If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as `12005`.
            Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more granular
            way, you can create a `DOUBLE CUMULATIVE` metric whose `unit` is `ks{CPU}`,
            and then write the value `12.005` (which is `12005/1000`), or use `Kis{CPU}`
            and write `11.723` (which is `12005/1024`). The supported units are a
            subset of [The Unified Code for Units of Measure](https://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html)
            standard: **Basic units (UNIT)** * `bit` bit * `By` byte * `s` second
            * `min` minute * `h` hour * `d` day * `1` dimensionless **Prefixes (PREFIX)**
            * `k` kilo (10^3) * `M` mega (10^6) * `G` giga (10^9) * `T` tera (10^12)
            * `P` peta (10^15) * `E` exa (10^18) * `Z` zetta (10^21) * `Y` yotta (10^24)
            * `m` milli (10^-3) * `u` micro (10^-6) * `n` nano (10^-9) * `p` pico
            (10^-12) * `f` femto (10^-15) * `a` atto (10^-18) * `z` zepto (10^-21)
            * `y` yocto (10^-24) * `Ki` kibi (2^10) * `Mi` mebi (2^20) * `Gi` gibi
            (2^30) * `Ti` tebi (2^40) * `Pi` pebi (2^50) **Grammar** The grammar also
            includes these connectors: * `/` division or ratio (as an infix operator).
            For examples, `kBy/{email}` or `MiBy/10ms` (although you should almost
            never have `/s` in a metric `unit`; rates should always be computed at
            query time from the underlying cumulative or delta value). * `.` multiplication
            or composition (as an infix operator). For examples, `GBy.d` or `k{watt}.h`.
            The grammar for a unit is as follows: Expression = Component: { "." Component
            } { "/" Component } ; Component = ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | "%" ) [ Annotation
            ] | Annotation | "1" ; Annotation = "{" NAME "}" ; Notes: * `Annotation`
            is just a comment if it follows a `UNIT`. If the annotation is used alone,
            then the unit is equivalent to `1`. For examples, `{request}/s == 1/s`,
            `By{transmitted}/s == By/s`. * `NAME` is a sequence of non-blank printable
            ASCII characters not containing `{` or `}`. * `1` represents a unitary
            [dimensionless unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity)
            of 1, such as in `1/s`. It is typically used when none of the basic units
            are appropriate. For example, "new users per day" can be represented as
            `1/d` or `{new-users}/d` (and a metric value `5` would mean "5 new users).
            Alternatively, "thousands of page views per day" would be represented
            as `1000/d` or `k1/d` or `k{page_views}/d` (and a metric value of `5.3`
            would mean "5300 page views per day"). * `%` represents dimensionless
            value of 1/100, and annotates values giving a percentage (so the metric
            values are typically in the range of 0..100, and a metric value `3` means
            "3 percent"). * `10^2.%` indicates a metric contains a ratio, typically
            in the range 0..1, that will be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage
            (so a metric value `0.03` means "3 percent").'

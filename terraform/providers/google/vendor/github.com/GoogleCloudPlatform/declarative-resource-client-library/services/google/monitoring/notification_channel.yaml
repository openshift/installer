            It is recommended that you specify a non-empty and unique name in order
            to make it easier to identify the channels in your project, though this
            is not enforced. The display name is limited to 512 Unicode characters.

          description: Whether notifications are forwarded to the described channel.
            This makes it possible to disable delivery of notifications to a particular
            channel without removing the channel from all alerting policies that reference
            the channel. This is a more convenient approach when the change is temporary
            and you want to receive notifications from the same set of alerting policies
            on the channel at some point in the future.

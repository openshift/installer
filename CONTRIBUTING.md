# How to Contribute

CoreOS projects are [Apache 2.0 licensed](LICENSE) and accept contributions via
GitHub pull requests. This document outlines some of the conventions on
development workflow, commit message formatting, contact points and other
resources to make it easier to get your contribution accepted.

## Certificate of Origin

By contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a
simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the
contribution. See the [DCO](DCO) file for details.

##  Reporting a security vulnerability

Due to their public nature, GitHub and mailing lists are not appropriate places for reporting vulnerabilities. Please refer to CoreOS's [security disclosure][disclosure] process when reporting issues that may be security related.

## Getting Started

- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Install [build dependencies](docs/dev/dependencies.md).
- Read the [README](README.md) for build and test instructions
- Play with the project, submit bugs, submit patches!

### Contribution Flow

Anyone may [file issues][new-issue].
For contributors who want to work up pull requests, the workflow is roughly:

1. Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (usually master).
2. Make commits of logical units.
3. Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see [below](#commit-message-format)).
4. Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
5. Make sure the tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.
6. We run a number of linters and tests on each pull request.
    You may wish to run these locally before submitting your pull request:
    ```sh
    hack/go-fmt.sh .
    hack/go-lint.sh $(go list -f '{{ .ImportPath }}' ./...)
    hack/go-vet.sh ./...
    hack/shellcheck.sh
    hack/tf-fmt.sh -list -check
    hack/tf-lint.sh
    ```
7. Submit a pull request to the original repository.
8. The [repo](OWNERS) [owners](OWNERS_ALIASES) will respond to your issue promptly, following [the ususal Prow workflow][prow-review].

Thanks for your contributions!

## Coding Style

The coding style suggested by the Golang community is used in installer. See the [style doc][golang-style] for details. Please follow them when working on your contributions.

Terraform has similar standards, and you can run `terraform fmt` to rewrite Terraform files to the canonical format.

## Commit Message Format

Write [good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) consistent with [Kubernetes Guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/guide#code-review).

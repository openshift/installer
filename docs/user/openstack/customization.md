## Cluster-scoped properties

* `cloud` (required string): The name of the OpenStack cloud to use from `clouds.yaml`.
* `computeFlavor` (required string): The OpenStack flavor to use for compute and control-plane machines.
    This is currently required, but has lower precedence than [the `type` property](#machine-pools) on [the `compute` and `controlPlane` machine-pools](../customization.md#platform-customization).
* `externalDNS` (optional list of strings): The IP addresses of DNS servers to be used for the DNS resolution of all instances in the cluster
* `externalNetwork` (optional string): Name of external network the installer will use to provide access to the cluster. If defined, a floating ip from this network will be created and associated with the bootstrap node to facilitate debugging and connection to the bootstrap node during installation. The lbFloatingIP property is a floating ip address selected from this network.
* `lbFloatingIP` (optional string): Address of existing Floating IP from externalNetwork the installer will associate with the API load balancer. This property is only valid if externalNetwork is defined. If externalNetwork is not defined, the installer will throw an error.
* `ingressFloatingIP` (optional string): Address of an existing Floating IP from externalNetwork the installer will associate with the ingress port. This property is only valid if externalNetwork is defined. If externalNetwork is not defined, the installer will throw an error.
* `octaviaSupport` (deprecated string): Whether OpenStack supports Octavia (`1` for true or `0` for false)
* `region` (deprecated string): The OpenStack region where the cluster will be created. Currently this value is not used by the installer.
* `trunkSupport` (deprecated string): Whether OpenStack ports can be trunked (`1` for true or `0` for false)
* `clusterOSImage` (optional string): Either a URL with `http(s)` or `file` scheme to override the default OS image for cluster nodes or an existing Glance image name.
* `apiVIP` (optional string): An IP address on the machineNetwork that will be assigned to the API VIP. Be aware that the `10` and `11` of the machineNetwork will be taken by neutron dhcp by default, and wont be available.
* `ingressVIP` (optional string): An IP address on the machineNetwork that will be assigned to the ingress VIP. Be aware that the `10` and `11` of the machineNetwork will be taken by neutron dhcp by default, and wont be available.
* `machinesSubnet` (optional string): the UUID of an OpenStack subnet to install the nodes of the cluster onto. For more information on how to install with a custom subnet, see the [custom subnets](#custom-subnets) section of the docs.

## Machine pools

* `additionalNetworkIDs` (optional list of strings): IDs of additional networks for machines.
* `additionalSecurityGroupIDs` (optional list of strings): IDs of additional security groups for machines.
* `type` (optional string): The OpenStack flavor name for machines in the pool.
* `rootVolume` (optional object): Defines the root volume for instances in the machine pool. The instances use ephemeral disks if not set.
  * `size` (required integer): Size of the root volume in GB. Must be set to at least 25.
  * `type` (required string): The volume pool to create the volume from.
* `zones` (optional list of strings): The names of the availability zones you want to install your nodes on. If unset, the installer will use your default compute zone.

**NOTE:** The bootstrap node follows the `type` and `rootVolume` parameters from the `controlPlane` machine pool.

**NOTE:** Note when deploying with `Kuryr` there is an Octavia API loadbalancer VM that will not fulfill the Availability Zones restrictions due to Octavia lack of support for it. In addition, if Octavia only has the amphora provider instead of also the OVN-Octavia provider, all the OpenShift services will be backed up by Octavia Load Balancer VMs which will not fulfill the Availability Zone restrictions either.


## Examples

Some example `install-config.yaml` are shown below.
For examples of platform-agnostic configuration fragments, see [here](../customization.md#examples).

### Minimal

An example minimal OpenStack install config is:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
platform:
  openstack:
    cloud: mycloud
    computeFlavor: m1.s2.xlarge
    externalNetwork: external
    externalDNS:
      - "8.8.8.8"
      - "192.168.1.12"
    lbFloatingIP: 128.0.0.1
pullSecret: '{"auths": ...}'
sshKey: ssh-ed25519 AAAA...
```

### Custom machine pools

An example OpenStack install config with custom machine pools:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
controlPlane:
  name: master
  replicas: 3
compute:
- name: worker
  platform:
    openstack:
      type: ml.large
      rootVolume:
        size: 30
        type: performance
  replicas: 3
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
platform:
  openstack:
    cloud: mycloud
    computeFlavor: m1.s2.xlarge
    externalNetwork: external
    lbFloatingIP: 128.0.0.1
pullSecret: '{"auths": ...}'
sshKey: ssh-ed25519 AAAA...
```

## Image Overrides

Normally the installer downloads the RHCOS image from a predetermined location described in [data/data/rhcos.json](/data/data/rhcos.json)). But the download URL can be overridden, notably for disconnected installations.

To do so and upload binary data from a custom location the user may set `clusterOSImage` parameter in the install config that points to that location, and then start the installation. In all other respects the process will be consistent with the default.

**NOTE:** For this to work, the parameter value must be a valid http(s) URL.

**NOTE:** The optional `sha256` query parameter can be attached to the URL, which will force the installer to check the image file checksum before uploading it into Glance.

Example:

```yaml
platform:
  openstack:
      clusterOSImage: http://mirror.example.com/images/rhcos-43.81.201912131630.0-openstack.x86_64.qcow2.gz?sha256=ffebbd68e8a1f2a245ca19522c16c86f67f9ac8e4e0c1f0a812b068b16f7265d
```

If the user wants to upload the image from the local file system, he can set `clusterOSImage` as `file:///path/to/file`. In this case the installer will take this file and automatically create an image in Glance.

Example:

```yaml
platform:
  openstack:
      clusterOSImage: file:///home/user/rhcos.qcow2
```

If the user wants to reuse an existing Glance image without any uploading of binary data, then it is possible to set `clusterOSImage` install config parameter that specifies the Glance image name. In this case no new Glance images will be created, and the image will stay when the cluster is destroyed. In other words, if `clusterOSImage` is not an "http(s)" or "file" URL, then the installer will look into Glance for an image with that name.

Example:

```yaml
platform:
  openstack:
      clusterOSImage: my-rhcos
```

## Custom Subnets

Before running the installer with a custom `machinesSubnet`, there are a few things you should check. First, make sure that you have a network and subnet available. Note that the installer will create ports on this network, and some ports will be given a fixed IP addresses in the subnet's CIDR. Make sure that the credentials that you give the installer are authorized to do this! The installer will also apply a tag to the subnet. Lastly, the installer will not create a router, so make sure to do this if you need a router to attach floating ip addresses to the network you want to install the nodes onto. Note that for now, this feature does not fully support provider networks.

Once that is ironed out, you can pass the ID of the subnet to the install config with the `machinesSubnet` option. This subnet will be tagged as the primary subnet for the cluster. The nodes, and VIP port will be created on this subnet. This does add some complexity to the install process that needs to be accounted for. First of all, the subnet must have DHCP enabled. Also, the CIDR of the custom subnet must match the cidr of `networks.machineNetwork`. Be aware that the API and Ingress VIPs by default will try to take the .5 and .7 of your network CIDR. To avoid other services taking the ports assigned to the api and ingress VIPs, it is recommended that users set the `apiVIP` and `ingressVIP` options in the install config to addresses that are outside of the DHCP allocation pool. Lastly, note that setting `externalDNS` while setting `machinesSubnet` is invalid usage, since the installer will not modify your subnet. If you want to add a DNS to your cluster while using a custom subnet, add it to the subnet in openstack [like this](https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/rocky/admin/config-dns-res.html).

## Additional Networks

You can set additional networks for your machines by defining `additionalNetworkIDs` parameter in the machine configuration. The parameter is a list of strings with additional network IDs:

```yaml
additionalNetworkIDs:
- <network1_uuid>
- <network2_uuid>
```

You can attach this parameter for both `controlPlane` and `compute` machines:

Example:

```yaml
compute:
- name: worker
  platform:
    openstack:
      additionalNetworkIDs:
      - fa806b2f-ac49-4bce-b9db-124bc64209bf
controlPlane:
  name: master
  platform:
    openstack:
      additionalNetworkIDs:
      - fa806b2f-ac49-4bce-b9db-124bc64209bf
```

**NOTE:** Allowed address pairs won't be created for the additional networks.

## Additional Security Groups

You can set additional security groups for your machines by defining `additionalSecurityGroupIDs` parameter in the machine configuration. The parameter is a list of strings with additional security group IDs:

```yaml
additionalSecurityGroupIDs:
- <security_group1_id>
- <security_group2_id>
```

You can attach this parameter for both `controlPlane` and `compute` machines:

Example:

```yaml
compute:
- name: worker
  platform:
    openstack:
      additionalSecurityGroupIDs:
      - 7ee219f3-d2e9-48a1-96c2-e7429f1b0da7
controlPlane:
  name: master
  platform:
    openstack:
      additionalSecurityGroupIDs:
      - 7ee219f3-d2e9-48a1-96c2-e7429f1b0da7
```

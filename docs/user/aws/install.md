### Running Cluster

In Route53, there will be a new, private hosted zone (for internal lookups):

In EC2, there will be 6 running instances:

The relationship of the EC2 instances, elastic load balancers (ELBs) and Route53 hosted zones is as depicted:

![Architecture relationship of ELBs and instances](images/install_nodes_elbs.png)

The nodes within the VPC utilize the internal DNS and use the Router and Internal API load balancers. External/Internet
access to the cluster use the Router and External API load balancers. Nodes are spread equally across 3 availability
zones.

The OpenShift console is available via the kubeadmin login provided by the installer:

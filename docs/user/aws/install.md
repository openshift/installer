# Cluster Installation

At this point, you are ready to perform the OpenShift installation. You have two choices for installing your cluster on
AWS, Installer-Provided Infrastructure (IPI) or User-Provided Infrastructure (UPI). See below for an example of an
IPI install.

To see a guided example of a UPI install, please see [Install: User-Provided Infrastructure](install_upi.md)

## Example: Installer-Provided Infrastructure (IPI)

The steps for performing an IPI-based install are outlined [here][cloud-install]. Following this guide you may begin at
Step 3: Download the Installer.

### Create Configuration

```console
$ openshift-install create install-config
? SSH Public Key /home/user_id/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
? Platform aws
? Region us-east-1
? Base Domain example.com
? Cluster Name test
? Pull Secret [? for help]
```

### Create Cluster

```console
$ openshift-install create cluster
INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the Kubernetes API at https://api.test.example.com:6443...
INFO API v1.11.0+85a0623 up
INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the bootstrap-complete event...
INFO Destroying the bootstrap resources...
INTO Waiting up to 30m0s for the cluster at https://api.test.example.com:6443 to initialize...
INFO Waiting up to 10m0s for the openshift-console route to be created...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/user/auth/kubeconfig'

```

### Running Cluster

In Route53, there will be a new, private hosted zone (for internal lookups):

![Route53 private hosted zone](images/install_private_hosted_zone.png)

In EC2, there will be 6 running instances:

![EC2 instances after install](images/install_nodes.png)

Instance root volumes for the bootstrap and contro-plane machines are encrypted.
The encryption uses the default EBS key for your target account and region
(`aws kms describe-key --key-id alias/aws/ebs`).

An architecture diagram for the AWS elements created by the full installation is as depicted:

![Architecture relationship of ELBs and instances](images/install_upi.svg)

The nodes within the VPC utilize the internal DNS and use the Router and Internal API load balancers. External/Internet
access to the cluster use the Router and External API load balancers. Nodes are spread equally across 3 availability
zones.

The OpenShift console is available via the kubeadmin login provided by the installer:

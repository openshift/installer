# OpenStack Development Environment

First, see if you have access to an OpenStack cloud that meets the
[requirements](../user/openstack/README.md).  If so, you may just point the
installer at that cloud.

If you would like to set up an isolated development environment, you may use a
bare metal host running CentOS 7.  The following repository includes some
instructions and scripts to help with creating a single-node OpenStack
development environment for running the installer.  Please refer to the
documentation in that repository for further details.

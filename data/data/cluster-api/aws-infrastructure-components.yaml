                          Valid values are: Disabled, AMDEncryptedVirtualizationNestedPaging
                          When set to Disabled, confidential computing will be disabled for the instance.
                          When set to AMDEncryptedVirtualizationNestedPaging, AMD SEV-SNP will be used as the confidential computing technology for the instance.
                          In this case, ensure the following conditions are met:
                          1) The selected instance type supports AMD SEV-SNP.
                          2) The selected AWS region supports AMD SEV-SNP.
                          3) The selected AMI supports AMD SEV-SNP.

                          always returns the version 2.0 credentials; the version 1.0 credentials are

                      This can be used to instruct Ignition from where to fetch the user data to bootstrap an instance.

                      When omitted, the storage option will default to ClusterObjectStore.

                      When set to "ClusterObjectStore", if the capability is available and a Cluster ObjectStore configuration
                      is correctly provided in the Cluster object (under .spec.s3Bucket),
                      an object store will be used to store bootstrap user data.

                      When set to "UnencryptedUserData", EC2 Instance User Data will be used to store the machine bootstrap user data, unencrypted.
                      This option is considered less secure than others as user data may contain sensitive informations (keys, certificates, etc.)
                      and users with ec2:DescribeInstances permission or users running pods
                      that can access the ec2 metadata service have access to this sensitive information.

                  ImageLookupFormat is the AMI naming format to look up the image for this

                  substitutions for {{.BaseOS}} and {{.K8sVersion}} with the base OS and
                  kubernetes version, respectively. The BaseOS will be the value in
                  ImageLookupBaseOS or ubuntu (the default), and the kubernetes version as
                  defined by the packages produced by kubernetes/release without v as a
                  prefix: 1.13.0, 1.12.5-mybuild.1, or 1.17.3. For example, the default
                  image format of capa-ami-{{.BaseOS}}-?{{.K8sVersion}}-* will end up
                  searching for AMIs that match the pattern capa-ami-ubuntu-?1.18.0-* for a

                  for machine interpretation.

                  This field should not be set for transitive errors that a controller
                  faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over
                  time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is
                  fundamentally wrong with the Machine's spec or the configuration of
                  the controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples
                  of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the
                  spec, values that are unsupported by the controller, or the
                  responsible controller itself being critically misconfigured.

                  Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines
                  can be added as events to the Machine object and/or logged in the
                  controller's output.

                              kube-proxy is automatically installed into the cluster. For clusters where you want
                              to use kube-proxy functionality that is provided with an alternate CNI, this option
                              provides a way to specify that the kube-proxy daemonset should be deleted. You cannot
                              set this to true if you are using the Amazon kube-proxy addon.

                                  By default, when creating a VPC, AWS creates a security group called `default` with ingress and egress
                                  rules that allow traffic from anywhere. The group could be used as a potential surface attack and
                                  it's generally suggested that the group rules are removed or modified appropriately.

                                  NOTE: This only applies when the VPC is managed by the Cluster API AWS controller.

                                      messageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails.
                                      Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string.
                                      If both message and messageExpression are present on a rule, then messageExpression will be used if validation
                                      fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the validation failure message is produced
                                      as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string
                                      that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset.
                                      messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is the return type.

                                creates a new object from the template referenced and hands off remediation of the machine to
                                a controller that lives outside of Cluster API.

                                    If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                                    should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                                    For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                                    "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                                    the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                                    index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of

                                    older MachineSets (usually present during rollout operations) aren't allowed to remediate.

                                    Note: In general (independent of remediations), unhealthy machines are always
                                    prioritized during scale down operations over healthy ones.

                                    MaxInFlight can be set to a fixed number or a percentage.
                                    Example: when this is set to 20%, the MachineSet controller deletes at most 20% of
                                    the desired replicas.

                                    If not set, remediation is limited to all machines (bounded by replicas)
                                    under the active MachineSet's management.

                                            e.g. when validation checks if a specific attribute `foo` under a map `testMap`, the fieldPath could be set to `.testMap.foo`

                                            It supports child operation to refer to an existing field currently. Refer to [JSONPath support in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/) for more info.

                                            For field name which contains special characters, use `['specialName']` to refer the field name.

                                            messageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails.
                                            Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string.
                                            If both message and messageExpression are present on a rule, then messageExpression will be used if validation
                                            fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the validation failure message is produced
                                            as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string
                                            that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset.
                                            messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is the return type.

                                      messageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails.
                                      Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string.
                                      If both message and messageExpression are present on a rule, then messageExpression will be used if validation
                                      fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the validation failure message is produced
                                      as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string
                                      that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset.
                                      messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is the return type.

                                    maxInFlight determines how many in flight remediations should happen at the same time.

                                    Remediation only happens on the MachineSet with the most current revision, while
                                    older MachineSets (usually present during rollout operations) aren't allowed to remediate.

                                    Note: In general (independent of remediations), unhealthy machines are always
                                    prioritized during scale down operations over healthy ones.

                                    MaxInFlight can be set to a fixed number or a percentage.
                                    Example: when this is set to 20%, the MachineSet controller deletes at most 20% of
                                    the desired replicas.

                                    If not set, remediation is limited to all machines (bounded by replicas)
                                    under the active MachineSet's management.

                                            fieldPath represents the field path returned when the validation fails.
                                            It must be a relative JSON path (i.e. with array notation) scoped to the location of this x-kubernetes-validations extension in the schema and refer to an existing field.
                                            e.g. when validation checks if a specific attribute `foo` under a map `testMap`, the fieldPath could be set to `.testMap.foo`
                                            If the validation checks two lists must have unique attributes, the fieldPath could be set to either of the list: e.g. `.testList`
                                            It does not support list numeric index.
                                            It supports child operation to refer to an existing field currently. Refer to [JSONPath support in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/jsonpath/) for more info.
                                            Numeric index of array is not supported.
                                            For field name which contains special characters, use `['specialName']` to refer the field name.
                                            e.g. for attribute `foo.34$` appears in a list `testList`, the fieldPath could be set to `.testList['foo.34$']`

                                            message represents the message displayed when validation fails. The message is required if the Rule contains
                                            line breaks. The message must not contain line breaks.

                                            messageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails.
                                            Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string.
                                            If both message and messageExpression are present on a rule, then messageExpression will be used if validation
                                            fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the validation failure message is produced
                                            as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string
                                            that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset.
                                            messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is the return type.
                                            Example:

                                        maxInFlight determines how many in flight remediations should happen at the same time.

                                        Remediation only happens on the MachineSet with the most current revision, while
                                        older MachineSets (usually present during rollout operations) aren't allowed to remediate.

                                        Note: In general (independent of remediations), unhealthy machines are always
                                        prioritized during scale down operations over healthy ones.

                                        MaxInFlight can be set to a fixed number or a percentage.
                                        Example: when this is set to 20%, the MachineSet controller deletes at most 20% of

                                        If not set, remediation is limited to all machines (bounded by replicas)
                                        under the active MachineSet's management.

                                          Note: We have to use apiextensionsv1.JSON instead of a custom JSON type, because controller-tools has a

                  strategy is the deployment strategy to use to replace existing machines with
                  new ones.

                        description: |-
                          maxSurge is the maximum number of machines that can be scheduled above the
                          desired number of machines.
                          Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of
                          desired machines (ex: 10%).
                          This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                          Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.
                          Defaults to 1.
                          Example: when this is set to 30%, the new MachineSet can be scaled
                          up immediately when the rolling update starts, such that the total
                          number of old and new machines do not exceed 130% of desired
                          machines. Once old machines have been killed, new MachineSet can
                          be scaled up further, ensuring that total number of machines running
                          at any time during the update is at most 130% of desired machines.

                          maxUnavailable is the maximum number of machines that can be unavailable during the update.

                          machines (ex: 10%).
                          Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down.
                          This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0.
                          Defaults to 0.
                          Example: when this is set to 30%, the old MachineSet can be scaled
                          down to 70% of desired machines immediately when the rolling update
                          starts. Once new machines are ready, old MachineSet can be scaled
                          down further, followed by scaling up the new MachineSet, ensuring
                          that the total number of machines available at all times
                          during the update is at least 70% of desired machines.

                          If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different
                          than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix.
                          The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field,
                          and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value
                          unique on the server.

                          If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will
                          NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason
                          ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client
                          should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

                          Applied only if Name is not specified.

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          The default value is 0, meaning that the node can be drained without any time limitations.

                          providerID is the identification ID of the machine provided by the provider.
                          This field must match the provider ID as seen on the node object corresponding to this machine.
                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                      remediation controls the strategy of remediating unhealthy machines
                      and how remediating operations should occur during the lifecycle of the dependant MachineSets.

                        description: |-
                          maxInFlight determines how many in flight remediations should happen at the same time.

                          Remediation only happens on the MachineSet with the most current revision, while
                          older MachineSets (usually present during rollout operations) aren't allowed to remediate.

                          Note: In general (independent of remediations), unhealthy machines are always
                          prioritized during scale down operations over healthy ones.

                          MaxInFlight can be set to a fixed number or a percentage.
                          Example: when this is set to 20%, the MachineSet controller deletes at most 20% of
                          the desired replicas.

                          If not set, remediation is limited to all machines (bounded by replicas)
                          under the active MachineSet's management.

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          This field can be used e.g. by Cluster API control plane providers to extend the semantic of the
                          Ready condition for the Machine they control, like the kubeadm control provider adding ReadinessGates
                          for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

                          Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                          they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                          NOTE: This field is considered only for computing v1beta2 conditions.
                          NOTE: In case readinessGates conditions start with the APIServer, ControllerManager, Scheduler prefix, and all those
                          readiness gates condition are reporting the same message, when computing the Machine's Ready condition those
                          readinessGates will be replaced by a single entry reporting "Control plane components: " + message.

                    description: |-
                      maxInFlight determines how many in flight remediations should happen at the same time.

                      Remediation only happens on the MachineSet with the most current revision, while
                      older MachineSets (usually present during rollout operations) aren't allowed to remediate.

                      Note: In general (independent of remediations), unhealthy machines are always
                      prioritized during scale down operations over healthy ones.

                      MaxInFlight can be set to a fixed number or a percentage.
                      Example: when this is set to 20%, the MachineSet controller deletes at most 20% of
                      the desired replicas.

                      If not set, remediation is limited to all machines (bounded by replicas)
                      under the active MachineSet's management.

                    - if the replicas field of the old MachineDeployment is > max size, use max size
                    - if the replicas field of the old MachineDeployment is in the (min size, max size) range, keep the value from the oldMD
                  * otherwise use 1
                  Note: Defaulting will be run whenever the replicas field is not set:

                  * On an existing MachineDeployment the replicas field was first set and is now unset.
                  Those cases are especially relevant for the following Kubernetes autoscaler use cases:
                  * A new MachineDeployment is created and replicas should be managed by the autoscaler
                  * An existing MachineDeployment which initially wasn't controlled by the autoscaler
                    should be later controlled by the autoscaler

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          This field can be used e.g. by Cluster API control plane providers to extend the semantic of the
                          Ready condition for the Machine they control, like the kubeadm control provider adding ReadinessGates
                          for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

                          Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                          they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                          NOTE: In case readinessGates conditions start with the APIServer, ControllerManager, Scheduler prefix, and all those
                          readiness gates condition are reporting the same message, when computing the Machine's Ready condition those
                          readinessGates will be replaced by a single entry reporting "Control plane components: " + message.

                          If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different

                          and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value
                          unique on the server.

                          If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will
                          NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason

                          should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          This field can be used e.g. by Cluster API control plane providers to extend the semantic of the

                          for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

                          Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                          they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                          NOTE: This field is considered only for computing v1beta2 conditions.

                          readiness gates condition are reporting the same message, when computing the Machine's Ready condition those

                        should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:

                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a

                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver

                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                          they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                  This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                  with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                  machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                  generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                  able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                  and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                  This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will

                  This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                  with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                  machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                  generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                  able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                  and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                  This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                  be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                  they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                  This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will

                  Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                  they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                  In the event that there is a terminal problem reconciling the

                  fundamentally wrong with the MachineTemplate's spec or the configuration of
                  the machine controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples
                  of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the
                  spec, values that are unsupported by the machine controller, or the
                  responsible machine controller itself being critically misconfigured.

                  Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines
                  can be added as events to the MachineSet object and/or logged in the

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                  These fields should not be set for transitive errors that a

                  fundamentally wrong with the MachineTemplate's spec or the configuration of
                  the machine controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples
                  of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the
                  spec, values that are unsupported by the machine controller, or the
                  responsible machine controller itself being critically misconfigured.

                  Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines
                  can be added as events to the MachineSet object and/or logged in the

                        A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that
                        relates the key and values.

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          readinessGates specifies additional conditions to include when evaluating Machine Ready condition.

                          This field can be used e.g. by Cluster API control plane providers to extend the semantic of the
                          Ready condition for the Machine they control, like the kubeadm control provider adding ReadinessGates
                          for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

                          Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                          they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                          NOTE: This field is considered only for computing v1beta2 conditions.
                          NOTE: In case readinessGates conditions start with the APIServer, ControllerManager, Scheduler prefix, and all those
                          readiness gates condition are reporting the same message, when computing the Machine's Ready condition those
                          readinessGates will be replaced by a single entry reporting "Control plane components: " + message.
                          This helps to improve readability of conditions bubbling up to the Machine's owner resource / to the Cluster).

                      58 characters and will

                      Length of the template string must not exceed 256 characters.
                      The template allows the following variables `.cluster.name`,

                      The variable `.random` is substituted with random alphanumeric string,

                  This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and unspecified.

                  Defaults to:
                  * if the Kubernetes autoscaler min size and max size annotations are set:
                    - if it's a new MachineSet, use min size
                    - if the replicas field of the old MachineSet is < min size, use min size
                    - if the replicas field of the old MachineSet is > max size, use max size
                    - if the replicas field of the old MachineSet is in the (min size, max size) range, keep the value from the oldMS
                  * otherwise use 1
                  Note: Defaulting will be run whenever the replicas field is not set:
                  * A new MachineSet is created with replicas not set.
                  * On an existing MachineSet the replicas field was first set and is now unset.
                  Those cases are especially relevant for the following Kubernetes autoscaler use cases:
                  * A new MachineSet is created and replicas should be managed by the autoscaler
                  * An existing MachineSet which initially wasn't controlled by the autoscaler
                    should be later controlled by the autoscaler

                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          This field can be used e.g. by Cluster API control plane providers to extend the semantic of the

                          for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

                          Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                          they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                          NOTE: In case readinessGates conditions start with the APIServer, ControllerManager, Scheduler prefix, and all those
                          readiness gates condition are reporting the same message, when computing the Machine's Ready condition those

                          These fields should not be set for transitive errors that a
                          controller faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over
                          time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is
                          fundamentally wrong with the MachineTemplate's spec or the configuration of
                          the machine controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples
                          of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the
                          spec, values that are unsupported by the machine controller, or the
                          responsible machine controller itself being critically misconfigured.

                          Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines
                          can be added as events to the MachineSet object and/or logged in the
                          controller's output.

                      In case the ControlPlaneEndpoint is not specified, the AdvertiseAddress + BindPort

                      Possible usages are:
                      e.g. In a cluster with more than one control plane instances, this field should be
                      assigned the address of the external load balancer in front of the
                      control plane instances.
                      e.g.  in environments with enforced node recycling, the ControlPlaneEndpoint
                      could be used for assigning a stable DNS to the control plane.

                  useExperimentalRetryJoin replaces a basic kubeadm command with a shell
                  script with retries for joins.

                  This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments
                  where joins fail due to timing (and other issues). The long term goal is to add retries to
                  kubeadm proper and use that functionality.

                  This will add about 40KB to userdata

                      In case the ControlPlaneEndpoint is not specified, the AdvertiseAddress + BindPort

                      Possible usages are:
                      e.g. In a cluster with more than one control plane instances, this field should be
                      assigned the address of the external load balancer in front of the
                      control plane instances.
                      e.g.  in environments with enforced node recycling, the ControlPlaneEndpoint
                      could be used for assigning a stable DNS to the control plane.

                  This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments

                  kubeadm proper and use that functionality.

                      e.g. In a cluster with more than one control plane instances, this field should be
                      assigned the address of the external load balancer in front of the
                      control plane instances.
                      e.g.  in environments with enforced node recycling, the ControlPlaneEndpoint
                      could be used for assigning a stable DNS to the control plane.

                          directory is a path to a directory that contains files named "target[suffix][+patchtype].extension".
                          For example, "kube-apiserver0+merge.yaml" or just "etcd.json". "target" can be one of
                          "kube-apiserver", "kube-controller-manager", "kube-scheduler", "etcd". "patchtype" can be one
                          of "strategic" "merge" or "json" and they match the patch formats supported by kubectl.
                          The default "patchtype" is "strategic". "extension" must be either "json" or "yaml".
                          "suffix" is an optional string that can be used to determine which patches are applied
                          first alpha-numerically.
                          These files can be written into the target directory via KubeadmConfig.Files which

                          by referencing a secret.

                  useExperimentalRetryJoin replaces a basic kubeadm command with a shell
                  script with retries for joins.

                  This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments
                  where joins fail due to timing (and other issues). The long term goal is to add retries to
                  kubeadm proper and use that functionality.

                  This will add about 40KB to userdata

                        versions >= v1.22.0 which use the old registry (k8s.gcr.io). Please use
                        a newer patch version with the new registry instead (i.e. >= v1.22.17,
                        >= v1.23.15, >= v1.24.9, >= v1.25.0).
                      * If the version is a CI build (kubernetes version starts with `ci/` or `ci-cross/`)
                       `gcr.io/k8s-staging-ci-images` will be used as a default for control plane components
                        and for kube-proxy, while `registry.k8s.io` will be used for all the other images.

                              ControlPlaneEndpoint sets a stable IP address or DNS name for the control plane; it
                              can be a valid IP address or a RFC-1123 DNS subdomain, both with optional TCP port.
                              In case the ControlPlaneEndpoint is not specified, the AdvertiseAddress + BindPort
                              are used; in case the ControlPlaneEndpoint is specified but without a TCP port,
                              the BindPort is used.
                              Possible usages are:
                              e.g. In a cluster with more than one control plane instances, this field should be
                              assigned the address of the external load balancer in front of the
                              control plane instances.
                              e.g.  in environments with enforced node recycling, the ControlPlaneEndpoint
                              could be used for assigning a stable DNS to the control plane.
                              NB: This value defaults to the first value in the Cluster object status.apiEndpoints array.

                                      when token-based discovery is used. The root CA found during discovery
                                      must match one of these values. Specifying an empty set disables root CA
                                      pinning, which can be unsafe. Each hash is specified as "<type>:<value>",
                                      where the only currently supported type is "sha256". This is a hex-encoded
                                      SHA-256 hash of the Subject Public Key Info (SPKI) object in DER-encoded
                                      ASN.1. These hashes can be calculated using, for example, OpenSSL:

                          This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments
                          where joins fail due to timing (and other issues). The long term goal is to add retries to
                          kubeadm proper and use that functionality.

                              e.g. In a cluster with more than one control plane instances, this field should be
                              assigned the address of the external load balancer in front of the
                              control plane instances.

                              could be used for assigning a stable DNS to the control plane.
                              NB: This value defaults to the first value in the Cluster object status.apiEndpoints array.

                          script with retries for joins.

                          This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments
                          where joins fail due to timing (and other issues). The long term goal is to add retries to
                          kubeadm proper and use that functionality.

                              may reject unrecognized values.

                              controlPlaneEndpoint sets a stable IP address or DNS name for the control plane; it
                              can be a valid IP address or a RFC-1123 DNS subdomain, both with optional TCP port.
                              In case the ControlPlaneEndpoint is not specified, the AdvertiseAddress + BindPort

                              e.g. In a cluster with more than one control plane instances, this field should be
                              assigned the address of the external load balancer in front of the
                              control plane instances.
                              e.g.  in environments with enforced node recycling, the ControlPlaneEndpoint
                              could be used for assigning a stable DNS to the control plane.
                              NB: This value defaults to the first value in the Cluster object status.apiEndpoints array.

                          This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments
                          where joins fail due to timing (and other issues). The long term goal is to add retries to
                          kubeadm proper and use that functionality.

                              assigned the address of the external load balancer in front of the
                              control plane instances.
                              e.g.  in environments with enforced node recycling, the ControlPlaneEndpoint
                              could be used for assigning a stable DNS to the control plane.
                              NB: This value defaults to the first value in the Cluster object status.apiEndpoints array.

                                            "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".

                                            exists or not.

                      If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                      should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                      "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                      the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                      index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                      referencing a part of an object.

                          e.g. In a cluster with more than one control plane instances, this field should be

                      This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments

                      This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments
                      where joins fail due to timing (and other issues). The long term goal is to add retries to
                      kubeadm proper and use that functionality.

                          are used; in case the ControlPlaneEndpoint is specified but without a TCP port,
                          the BindPort is used.
                          Possible usages are:
                          e.g. In a cluster with more than one control plane instances, this field should be
                          assigned the address of the external load balancer in front of the
                          control plane instances.
                          e.g.  in environments with enforced node recycling, the ControlPlaneEndpoint
                          could be used for assigning a stable DNS to the control plane.
                          NB: This value defaults to the first value in the Cluster object status.apiEndpoints array.

                      This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments
                      where joins fail due to timing (and other issues). The long term goal is to add retries to
                      kubeadm proper and use that functionality.

                              Environment variables passed using ExtraEnvs will override any existing environment variables, or *_proxy environment variables that kubeadm adds by default.
                              This option takes effect only on Kubernetes >=1.31.0.

                                  could be used for assigning a stable DNS to the control plane.

                              useExperimentalRetryJoin replaces a basic kubeadm command with a shell
                              script with retries for joins.

                              This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments
                              where joins fail due to timing (and other issues). The long term goal is to add retries to
                              kubeadm proper and use that functionality.

                                  desired number of control planes.
                                  Value can be an absolute number 1 or 0.
                                  Defaults to 1.
                                  Example: when this is set to 1, the control plane can be scaled
                                  up immediately when the rolling update starts.

                                            "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".

                                            exists or not.

                              script with retries for joins.

                              This is meant to be an experimental temporary workaround on some environments
                              where joins fail due to timing (and other issues). The long term goal is to add retries to
                              kubeadm proper and use that functionality.

                              This will add about 40KB to userdata

                                  could be used for assigning a stable DNS to the control plane.

                                            "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".

                                            exists or not.

                                      maxSurge is the maximum number of control planes that can be scheduled above or under the
                                      desired number of control planes.
                                      Value can be an absolute number 1 or 0.
                                      Defaults to 1.
                                      Example: when this is set to 1, the control plane can be scaled
                                      up immediately when the rolling update starts.

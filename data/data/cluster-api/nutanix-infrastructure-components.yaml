                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                      "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                              For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                              "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                              the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                              index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of

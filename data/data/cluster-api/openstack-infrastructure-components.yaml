                              CPUPolicy is used to pin the virtual CPUs (vCPUs) of instances to the
                              host's physical CPU cores (pCPUs). Host aggregates should be used to
                              separate these pinned instances from unpinned instances as the latter
                              will not respect the resourcing requirements of the former.

                              Permitted values are shared (the default), and dedicated.

                              shared: The guest vCPUs will be allowed to freely float across host
                              pCPUs, albeit potentially constrained by NUMA policy.

                              dedicated: The guest vCPUs will be strictly pinned to a set of host
                              pCPUs. In the absence of an explicit vCPU topology request, the
                              drivers typically expose all vCPUs as sockets with one core and one
                              thread. When strict CPU pinning is in effect the guest CPU topology
                              will be setup to match the topology of the CPUs to which it is
                              pinned. This option implies an overcommit ratio of 1.0. For example,
                              if a two vCPU guest is pinned to a single host core with two threads,
                              then the guest will get a topology of one socket, one core, two
                              threads.

                              how hardware CPU threads in a simultaneous multithreading-based (SMT)
                              architecture be used. SMT-based architectures include Intel
                              processors with Hyper-Threading technology. In these architectures,
                              processor cores share a number of components with one or more other
                              cores. Cores in such architectures are commonly referred to as
                              hardware threads, while the cores that a given core share components
                              with are known as thread siblings.

                              Permitted values are prefer (the default), isolate, and require.

                              prefer: The host may or may not have an SMT architecture. Where an
                              SMT architecture is present, thread siblings are preferred.

                              isolate: The host must not have an SMT architecture or must emulate a
                              non-SMT architecture. If the host does not have an SMT architecture,
                              each vCPU is placed on a different core as expected. If the host does
                              have an SMT architecture - that is, one or more cores have thread
                              siblings - then each vCPU is placed on a different physical core. No
                              vCPUs from other guests are placed on the same core. All but one
                              thread sibling on each utilized core is therefore guaranteed to be
                              unusable.

                              require: The host must have an SMT architecture. Each vCPU is
                              allocated on thread siblings. If the host does not have an SMT
                              architecture, then it is not used. If the host has an SMT
                              architecture, but not enough cores with free thread siblings are
                              available, then scheduling fails.

                  IP to the API server (and hence, in many cases, exposing the API server to the internet)
                  is not possible or desirable, e.g. if using a shared VLAN for communication between
                  management and workload clusters or when the management cluster is inside the
                  project network.
                  This option requires that the API server use a VIP on the cluster network so that the
                  underlying machines can change without changing ControlPlaneEndpoint.Host.
                  When using a managed load balancer, this VIP will be managed automatically.
                  If not using a managed load balancer, cluster configuration will fail without additional
                  configuration to manage the VIP on the control plane machines, which falls outside of
                  the scope of this controller.

                  is not possible or desirable, e.g. if using a shared VLAN for communication between
                  management and workload clusters or when the management cluster is inside the
                  project network.
                  This option requires that the API server use a VIP on the cluster network so that the
                  underlying machines can change without changing ControlPlaneEndpoint.Host.
                  When using a managed load balancer, this VIP will be managed automatically.
                  If not using a managed load balancer, cluster configuration will fail without additional
                  configuration to manage the VIP on the control plane machines, which falls outside of

                  NetworkMTU sets the maximum transmission unit (MTU) value to address fragmentation for the private network ID.
                  This value will be used only if the Cluster actuator creates the network.
                  If leaved empty, the network will have the default MTU defined in Openstack network service.
                  To use this field, the Openstack installation requires the net-mtu neutron API extension.

                  DisableAPIServerFloatingIP determines whether or not to attempt to attach a floating
                  IP to the API server. This allows for the creation of clusters when attaching a floating

                  is not possible or desirable, e.g. if using a shared VLAN for communication between
                  management and workload clusters or when the management cluster is inside the
                  project network.
                  This option requires that the API server use a VIP on the cluster network so that the
                  underlying machines can change without changing ControlPlaneEndpoint.Host.
                  When using a managed load balancer, this VIP will be managed automatically.
                  If not using a managed load balancer, cluster configuration will fail without additional
                  configuration to manage the VIP on the control plane machines, which falls outside of
                  the scope of this controller.

                  If ExternalNetwork is defined it must refer to exactly one external network.

                  If ExternalNetwork is not defined or is empty the controller will use any

                  error if ExternalNetwork is not defined and there are multiple
                  external networks unless DisableExternalNetwork is also set.

                  If ExternalNetwork is not defined and there are no external networks

                        For now this is only used for the allNodesSecurityGroupRules but when we add
                        other security groups, we'll need to add a validation because
                        Remote* fields are mutually exclusive.

                            instance. An egress rule is applied to traffic leaving the instance.

                          IP to the API server. This allows for the creation of clusters when attaching a floating
                          IP to the API server (and hence, in many cases, exposing the API server to the internet)
                          is not possible or desirable, e.g. if using a shared VLAN for communication between
                          management and workload clusters or when the management cluster is inside the
                          project network.
                          This option requires that the API server use a VIP on the cluster network so that the
                          underlying machines can change without changing ControlPlaneEndpoint.Host.
                          When using a managed load balancer, this VIP will be managed automatically.
                          If not using a managed load balancer, cluster configuration will fail without additional
                          configuration to manage the VIP on the control plane machines, which falls outside of
                          the scope of this controller.

                                      the fixed IP of a port in. This query must not return more than one subnet.
